This battleship game has 2 modes.

- **Mode 1:  Two players.**
This mode played by two players. Players each place their ships on a "N * N" board. The objective of this mode is to sink the opponent’s whole fleet.

Each player's fleet has several types of vessels. Generally, each following type of ship has one. Additionally, setting the numbers of each type of ship within limits is available. (e.g. You can set 3 battleship for each player)

- 1 Aircraft Carrier, 6 spots   (number range: 0~1)
- 1 Battleship, 5 spots        (number range: 0~3)

- 1 Destroyer, 3 spots         (number range: 0~3)
- 1 Submarine, 2 spots         (number range: 0~5)

Each player can attack by fire cannon ball to a specified position of the opponent's board. 

Each player attack just once a turn, then pass the turn to the opponent.

Attack effects will be fed back after each attack. Both sides get the result of whether a ship has been hit, and the position has been attacked would be shown on the board.

When a player’s whole fleets is sunk, the game ends.


- **Mode 2: Single player.**
